# Key code pieces and files for Alex Daneels (24702811) Masters project - junk code excluded from repo 


This repo contains the important code scripts used to fine-tune the ResNet-50 model (see tune_resnet.py), collect data (see map_room.py), build the visual database required for visual localisation (see create_database.py, plot_embeddings_ecdf.py). The final map files used for localisation and navigation are also included (see ESL_final_map_files/, smal_house_final_map_files/). The visual database components can also be found, this includes the fine-tuned model, FAISS index, related image paths, dataset mean and standard deviation and confidence function (see ESL_visual_database/, small_house_visual_database/). The custom ROS2 package containing all launch files, parameter files, config files and standalone scripts can all be found in rtabmap/ (completely seperate to the actualy RTAB-Map ROS2 package, package was created before naming conventions were decided). Note that this package contains SLAM, localisation and mapping solutions for the 2D and 3D case, indicated in the launch and parameter file names.
